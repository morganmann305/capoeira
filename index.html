<h2 id="history_of_capoeira">History of Capoeira</h2>
<p>Capoeira was created by African slaves in Brazil. The slaves were brought to Brazil during the Atlantic
Slave Trade. Most of the slaves are from Angola in Africa.</p>

<h2 id="basic_capoeira_moves">Basic Capoeira Moves</h2>

<p>The Ginga, Bananeira and Balança are a few of the basic moves used in Capoeira.</p>

<h3>Ginga</h3>
<p><strong>Ginga</strong> is the main movement used in capoeira. The capoeirista (person who practices capoeira) sways their body from side to side and raises their arms to their face to protect themselves from their opponent.</p>

<h3>Bananeira</h3>
<p><strong>Bananeira</strong> is basically a handstand and a capoeirista does this when they need a break and also to see what their opponent will do next.</p>

<h3>Balança</h3>
<p><strong>Balança</strong> involves the capoeirista swaying side to side with their knees bent while they protect their face with their arms. This movement deceives the opponent so they won't be able to know what the capoeirista will do next.</p>

<h2 id="capoeira_match">Capoeira Match</h2>
<p>This is an animation I created of two capoeiristas fighthing each other. The capoeiristas are doing the balança, bananeira and ginga moves. There are two men who are playing the atabaque and berimbau instruments. The instruments are essential to the game of capoeira and determine how the game will be played between the two players.</p>

<h2 id="belt_system">Belt System</h2>
<p>Capoeira ranks the skill level of capoeira students by using a belt system. The belt is a called a <em>cordão</em> and incorporates the colors of the Brazilian flag: blue, yellow, white and green. A student gets their belt at the Batizado (baptism) ceremony where they demonstrate their skill level in a capoeira match.</p>

<p>I created the graphic below which shows the belt system ranking and explains the capoeirista levels.</p>

<h2 id="capoeira_instruments">Capoeira Instruments</h2>
<p>Capoeira is a unique martial art because music is an integral part of a capoeira match. Below are a couple of instruments that are used during the Roda. A Roda is a circle formed by the capoeira students around the two opponents where they sing and clap to the sounds of the capoeira instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Berimbau</strong> is an African instrument and defines whether the capoeira game will be angola or regional. Capoeira Angola is a slower, less aggressive style of the martial art. Capoeira Regional is a faster, more aggressive style of the martial art.</p>

<p><strong>Atabaque</strong> is a drum that is played to create the beats and steps used in a capoeira match. The rhythm of the drum has 4 beats.</p>

<h2 id="capoeira_in_popular_culture">Capoeira in Popular Culture</h2>
<p>Capoeira has become popular in many countries. It has been used in popular culture as well. There is a fighting video game series called <em>Tekken</em> that has a character named Eddy Gordo who is a capoeirista.</p>

<p>Eddy Gordo is an Afro-Brazilian who uses his capoeira skills to fight his opponents in Tekken. The following link describes Eddy's role in Tekken <a href="http://tekken.wikia.com/wiki/Eddy_Gordo">Eddy Gordo</a>.</p>
